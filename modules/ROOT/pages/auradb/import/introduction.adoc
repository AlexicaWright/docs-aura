= Introduction

The import service contains a tool for importing data into your instance and is ideal to get started quickly with testing and prototyping.
It allows you to import data from flat files without using any code.
This means that you can import data from any source that can be exported to a flat file and does thus not require DBMS filesystem access.

This service is also available as a standalone tool and is accessible at link:https://data-importer.neo4j.io/[] using a secure connection.
Additionally, Data Importer standalone is also available at link:https://data-importer.graphapp.io/[] with both secure and insecure connections.
