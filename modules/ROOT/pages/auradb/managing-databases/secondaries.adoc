:description: This section introduces secondaries for scaling out read workloads.

label:AuraDB-Virtual-Dedicated-Cloud[]

A secondary is a read-only copy of your Aura database.
Secondaries help you scale the read query workload your database is able to serve, by spreading the load evenly across multiple copies of the data.
This increases the maximum read query throughput of a database while preventing bottlenecks.

To ensure high availability, secondaries are distributed across availability zones.
They are however, only available within same cloud region as the primary Aura instance.

Up to 15 secondaries can be added per Aura instance, which increases the read capacity to handle read-heavy workloads significantly.
Secondaries can be added, managed, and removed through the Aura console or the Aura API.
Currently, they are static and do not support elastic or auto-scaling behavior.

The secondary count is retained when the database is paused and resumed.
For example, if your database has three secondaries and you pause it, it will resume with three secondaries.

== Edit secondary count using the console

Once the feature is enabled for your project, you can see the secondary count set to zero on an instance card.
To edit the number of secondaries, use the *More* menu (three dots) on the card.

== Edit secondary count using the Aura API

Use the `/instances/{instanceId}` endpoint to edit the number of secondaries.
