= Connect to an instance
:description: This page describes how to connect to an instance using Neo4j AuraDB.

To interact with a database within an instance, you need to connect to it.

There are different ways to connect to an instance from the tools, Explore or Query.
Either you connect to a running instance or you select a remote connection.

If you are not connected to an instance when you open the Explore tool, you will be prompted to select an instance to connect to.
From the pop-up, you can also select _Remote connection_, if you want to connect to a different instance than the one currently running.

Select *Status* to connect, disconnect, or connect to instances you recently accessed.
This is available from both tools as well from the Import service.
