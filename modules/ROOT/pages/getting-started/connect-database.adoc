:description: This page describes how to connect to an instance using Neo4j AuraDB.

To interact with a database within an instance, you need to connect to it.

There are different ways to connect to an instance from the tools, Explore or Query.
Either you connect to the running instance or you select a remote connection.

== Connection banner

If you are not connected to an instance when you open the Explore tool, you will be prompted to select an instance to connect to.
From the pop-up, you can also select _Remnote connection_, if you want to connect to a different instance than the one currently running.

Select *Status* to connect, disconnect, or connect to instances you recently accessed.

== To open a remote instance from Explore or Query

. Select *Explore* or *Query*.
. When prompted to choose a connection method, select _Renmote_
. Enter the *Database user* and *Password* credentials.

. Select *Connect*.

// |Protocol
// |Don't worry about this and just use the default if you are a new user of Aura. Protocols are mainly for server-side routing vs client-side routing. We've seperated protocol and connection URL. The main reason for this, is being able to change these things independently. Users may want to use different protocols for the same instance URL, for example they get client-side routing with neo4j+s (better for clusters and single servers) or have a direct connection to the instance using bolt+s (not the default as it's less flexible).

// |Connection URL
// |You can get this from your instance details

// |Database user
// |Neo4j by default

// |Password
// |You are given the password when you initially create the instance

// |Single sign-on
// |If this is set up, you can use SSO.
